# Da bundl
Need to use modern JavaScript or TypeScript in not so modern enviroments? Just bundle it with Da bundl!

# Usage
Write any `.js` or `.ts`, use any package you want. All you have to do is to point to your entry file in `vite.config.js` run `npm run build` and voil√†! Your `/dist/` folder now have a freshly baked `.js` file usable in any enviroment.
That's really it, JavaScript made easy without using Deno.

It's not a serious project, just an autistic showcase, feel free to hack it however You want. It's just Vite.
